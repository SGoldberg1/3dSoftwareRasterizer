COORDINATE SYSTEM
	- [] CAMERA Z ROTATION
	- [] STANDARDIZE METRIX (1 UNIT = 1 METER)

ASSET PROCESSOR
	- [] BITMAP PROCESSING
	- [] OBJ FILE PROCESSING
	- [] FONT PROCESSING(.TFF TO BITMAP)

RENDERING
	- [X] PUSH BUFFER RENDERING
	- [X] (SOFTWARE)BITMAP ALPHA BLENDING
	- [] (SOFTWARE)BITMAP ROTATION AND SCALING
	- [] VISABILITY PROBLEM
	- [] SHADOWS
	- [X] 2D UV MAPPING
	- [] 3D UV MAPPING
	- [] (SOFTWARE)SHADER SYSTEM
	- [] CLIP MESH TRIANGLES(RE-TRIANGULATION)
	- [] CLIP3D LINES(CURRENTLY IF A VERTEX IS OUT OF CLIP SPACE, THE LINE IS DISCARDED)
    - [] CLAMP 3D LINE
	- [] FONTS(SCAN OUTPUT TEXT)
		. PUSH BUFFER IMPLEMENTATION HAS CHANGED THE NATURE OF TEXT OUPUT.
		. NEED TO SCAN INSIDE ENGINE AND PUSH BITMAPS OF CHARACTERS
		. CANNOT REFERENCE STRINGS ON THE STACK!! =D

PROCEDURAL GENERATION
	- [] SPHERE GENERATION COMPUTING INCORRECT NORMALS
	- [] RANDOM NUMBER GENERATION(LINEAR CONGRUENT GENERATION
		 NEED TO PACK RANDOM DATA:
			. MODULUS
			. SEED
			. LAST_NUMBER
			. INCREMENT
	- [] FIX HEX MESH GENERATION
			. TOO MANY TRIANGLES BEING GENERATED
			. EXTRA TRIANGLES CAN BE SEEN BENEATH THE MESH

MATH
	- [] IMPLEMENT QUANTERNION ROTATIONS
			- CURRENTLY ONLY HAVE EULER ROTATIONS: GIMBLE LOCK =(
	- [] REPLACE MATH.H IN ENGINE_MATH.CPP WITH MATHEMATICAL CALCULATIONS
		- [] TAYLOR SERIES FOR TRIG FUNCTIONS
	- [] IMPLEMENT CUSTOM MATRIX OPERATIONS (NO NEED TO MULTIPLY 0 BY VECTOR ELEMENT)

TEXT PROCESSING
	- [] R32 -> STRING
	- [] S32 -> STRING

PHYSICS
	- [] COLLISION
	- [] LAWS OF MOTION

PLATFORM LAYER
	- [X] LIVE CODING
	- [] AUDIO
	- [] OPENGL

DEBUG SYSTEMS
	- [] INTROSPECTION(META PROGRAMMING)
	- [] DIAGRAMING
	- [] ROUTINE CLOCKING AND CALL COUNT
	- [] LOGGING
		-[] ERRORS
		-[] FRAME LOGS
	- [] RUNTIME COMPILATION FOR EACH DEBUG SYSTEM

OPTIMIZATION
	- [] CHANGE COLUMN MAJOR MATRIX TO ROW MAJOR(POSSIBLY DROP 2D MATRIX ARRAY FOR 1D)
	- [] MULTI-THREADING
	- [] IMPLEMENT SIMD/INTRINSICS(INTEL TARGET SSE2? AND WHAT ABOUT AMD?)

		-> COULD RESULT IN INFINITE LOOP
			SHOULD SET MAX ITERATIONS???

	DrawBitmap
		-> DOES -1 TO HEIGHT MAKE SENSE?
				VERIFY CALCULATIONS
